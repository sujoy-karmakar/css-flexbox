Q.1 Describe the main difference between the css flexbox layout model and the css grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the other?

CSS Flexbox Layout Model:

Purpose: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as rows or columns. It's ideal for distributing space and aligning items within that single dimension.

Main Axis and Cross Axis: In a flex container, we have a main axis and a cross axis. we can control the alignment and distribution of items along the main axis, while the cross axis is primarily used for controlling alignment in the perpendicular direction.

Content Order: Flexbox allows content to be reorganized, and items can be reordered with respect to their source order.

Use Cases: Use Flexbox when we have a set of items in a single row or column and want to distribute space or align items within that row or column. It's great for creating navigation menus, flexible card layouts, and aligning content vertically or horizontally.


CSS Grid Layout Model:

Purpose: CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing we to create grid structures with rows and columns. It excels at defining the layout of both rows and columns, making it suitable for creating complex grid-based designs.

Grid Cells: we define a grid by creating rows and columns, and we can place items into specific grid cells. This makes Grid ideal for creating complex, structured layouts.

Implicit Grid: Grid can also handle content that exceeds the initially defined grid by automatically creating additional rows and columns as needed (the implicit grid).

Use Cases: Use CSS Grid when you have a more complex layout that involves both rows and columns. It's excellent for building entire page layouts, magazine-style designs, and other grid-based designs that require precise control over the placement of elements.

When to Choose One Over the Other:
Choose Flexbox when we need to arrange items in a single dimension, like creating navigation bars or aligning elements within a container. Flexbox is best for handling content within a row or column and for situations where the content order needs to change based on screen size or other factors.

Choose Grid when you need to create a two-dimensional layout, especially for entire web page layouts or designs that require complex alignment in both rows and columns. Grid is well-suited for situations where we want to establish a more structured grid system for your content.
